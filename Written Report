This analysis examines the performance of schools based on various factors such as budget, size, and type. Through categorizing student performance based on allocated resources and type of school, the analysis was able to identify trends among school and student performance and academic successes. 

The two conclusions this analysis draws is that of type such as district, and charter, and that of financial resources such as school budget per capita/per student budget. 

The analysis between types of schools based on academic performance through average math and reading scores, and passing students, charter schools generally had a higher average score in academics, and higher percentage of passing students. This relationship suggests that the type of school has a significant role in determining academic outcomes of students.  

The analysis based on accessible financial resources per students illustrates a surprising result in that higher total budget of schools or per student budget, is that higher financial resources doesnâ€™t not necessarily indicate greater academic performance for students. In a perhaps shocking trend, schools with lower per student budget and total school budget have a higher average or better academic performance than that of schools with higher financial resources. This trend challenges the assumption that higher funding automatically equals higher performance.
